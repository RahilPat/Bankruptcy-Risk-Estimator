# Bankruptcy-Risk-Estimator
In this project, I used python to estimate the chance of bankruptcy from qualitative parameters by experts. I built a Naive Bayes machine learning model, split the dataset into training and testing set, trained the model on the training set, and made predictions of the 'Class' for test set, and evaluated the model's accuracy.
